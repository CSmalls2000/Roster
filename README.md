# Roster
A Roster that implements sorted doubly linked list


Preface
For Data Structures, we were tasked with working in a group whether by choice or by professor
to solve a problem based on the data structure of our choice. The roster class is one of the
problems chosen and the data structure we chose to implement was sorted doubly linked list.

Desciption/Capabilities
The Roster class on its own can sort and display the students based on a specific attribute.
Each student can be sorted by their id, name, classification, gpa, and progress.

The Roster has an IO class to make it more usable to whoever is using the program.
The capabilites of the IO class expands what the Roster class does:
Students with a certain gpa or progress can be shown without getting rid of anyone in the original Roster.
Multiple students can be created and/or added to the Roster.
A student can be removed by their id or name.
A Roster can be made from a text file containing students.
